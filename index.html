                <h2>Hadith on Knowledge</h2>
                <p>Verily, the angels lower their wings for the seeker of knowledge. The inhabitants of the heavens and earth, even the fish in the depths of the water, seek forgiveness for the scholar. The virtue of a scholar over the worshiper is like the superiority of the moon over the stars. The scholars are the inheritors of the prophets. They do not leave behind gold or silver coins, but rather they leave behind knowledge and whoever has taken hold of it has been given an abundant share.</p>
